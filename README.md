## Smart Farming: Zone-based Data Lake Architecture
### Objective
The purpose is to propose a dedicated data lake functional architecture and extend it to a technical
architecture to initiate a fish farming data-driven strategy. The research opted for an exploratory
study to explore the existing big data technologies and to propose an architecture applicable to
the fish farming data-driven strategy. The paper provides a review of how big data technologies
offer multiple advantages for decision making and enabling prediction use cases. It also highlights
different big data technologies and their use. Finally, the paper presents the proposed architecture to
initiate a data-driven strategy in the fish farming domain.
