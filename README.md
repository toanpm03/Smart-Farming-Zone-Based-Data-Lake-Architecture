## Smart Farming: Zone-based Data Lake Architecture
### Objective
This paper aims to propose a dedicated data lake functional architecture and extend it to a technical
architecture to initiate a smart crop farming data-driven strategy. The paper provides a review of how big data technologies
offer multiple advantages for decision making and enabling prediction use cases. It also highlights
different big data technologies and their use.
